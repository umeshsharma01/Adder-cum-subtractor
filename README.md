# Adder-cum-subtractor
An Adder-Cum-Subtractor is a digital arithmetic circuit that can perform both addition and subtraction of binary numbers using a single hardware structure.
The operation is controlled by a select input usually called Mode or Control.
When the control input is set to 0 the circuit performs addition and when it is set to 1  the circuit performs subtraction.
Subtraction is achieved by taking the two’s complement of the second input and then adding it to the first input.
The Adder-Cum-Subtractor is widely used in ALUs and processors because it reduces hardware complexity while increasing functionality. 
It is an essential building block in digital arithmetic and computer architecture.
